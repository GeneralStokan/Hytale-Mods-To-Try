# Hytale-Mods-To-Try
Here are some mods that I believe are worth checking out! These mods that are either alternatives to popular mods that haven't updated in months or those I or you believe are better alternatives (check out the discussions to talk about these alternatives) I will also be adding newly release mods that deserve a spotlight. There will also be popualar mods in the list that are still getting regualar updates and support, but ones that seem abandoned or have a better alternative may not be included

Submit a Pull Request to add your own mods you believe should be on the list or check out discussions to recommend mods to be added

## Adventure & Content

|-----|-------------|-------|
| RPG Companion by: Stefman1234 | Adds a companion to the game! Equip gear, level them up and go on adventures. I will say this mod is pretty new and there are still bugs to figure out. Mod developer has short- and long-term goals | https://www.curseforge.com/hytale/mods/rpg-companion |

## Weapons, Tools & Armor

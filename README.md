# Hytale-Mods-To-Try
Here are some mods that I believe are worth checking out! These mods that are either alternatives to popular mods that haven't updated in months or those I or you believe are better alternatives (check out the discussions to talk about these alternatives) I will also be adding newly release mods that deserve a spotlight. There will also be popualar mods in the list that are still getting regualar updates and support, but ones that seem abandoned or have a better alternative may not be included

Submit a Pull Request to add your own mods you believe should be on the list or check out discussions to recommend mods to be added
